# Apex Web Services Superbadge

## Overview
This project involved the development of custom APIs using Apex, focusing on both **REST** and **SOAP** web services. By completing the **Apex Web Services Superbadge**, I demonstrated the ability to integrate Salesforce with external systems through robust and scalable web services.

## Key Features and Tasks
- **REST API**: Developed a REST API that provides product zoning information based on dynamic criteria. This involved setting up the necessary endpoints and handling different HTTP methods to retrieve and manipulate data.
  
- **SOAP Web Service**: Created a SOAP-based web service to verify the certification status of drone operators. The service returns information based on the validity of their certifications.

- **Testing and Validation**: Conducted comprehensive tests for both web services, ensuring they handled edge cases and operated reliably in various environments. The project also included writing unit tests to ensure high test coverage and meet production-quality standards.

## Skills Acquired
- Building and integrating **RESTful APIs** and **SOAP web services** with Salesforce
- Writing **unit tests** to ensure high-quality code and full test coverage
- Handling complex logic and integrating external systems with Salesforce
- Excercising troubleshooting and debugging skills within Apex-based web services

## Results
This superbadge, showcased my proficiency in developing, testing, and deploying web services in Salesforce, to handle real-world integration scenarios.
